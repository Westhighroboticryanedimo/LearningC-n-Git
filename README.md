# LearningC-n-Git - A Personal Journey Through C Programming with Git

Welcome fellow learners! This is my personal project where I am utilizing the power of Git to keep myself on track and organized during this exciting journey into learning how to program in C. As someone who'm still getting familiar with both programming concepts and version control systems, every step forward feels like a significant milestone for me.

## What You Can Expect From This Repository:
- **Project Structure**: The repository is structured around the basics of writing simple programs in C while also learning Git commands to manage my codebase effectively. I've divided it into several folders, each representing a different aspect or project within this journey - from setting up an environment and understanding basic syntaxes like loops and conditionals, all the way through more complex topics such as data structures (arrays, linked lists) and file handling operations.
- **Resources**: I've included some helpful resources in my `resources` folder for further learning outside of this repository - books, online courses, cheat sheets etc., which you might find useful too! 
- **Examples & Exercises**: In the exercises section (`exercises`), there are several problems I've worked on to solidify my understanding. These include simple programs like a calculator or basic games and also more complex ones that involve file handling, memory management etc., which can be found in `complex_projects`.
- **Git Commands**: In the `.git` folder, you will find examples of commands I've used to manage my codebase. This includes creating branches (`branches`), merging changes and resolving conflicts among others - all aimed at helping me learn how Git works in a practical way alongside C programming
- **Progress Tracking**: In the `progress` folder, you can find notes on what I've learned so far or tasks that are still pending. This is my personal progress tracker and it evolves as I continue learning more about both subjects! 

## How to Use this Repository?
- **Clone/Fork**: You may clone the repository using Git commands, fork on GitHub if you prefer a web interface or download directly from here. Once cloned or forked, feel free to explore and learn at your own pace - I've tried my best to make it beginner friendly! 
- **Contributions & Collaboration**: If there are any questions about the codebase or if you wish to contribute in some way (like fixing a bug), please open an issue on GitHub. This repository is designed for learning and collaboration, so I'm always happy to discuss with others who share similar interests!
- **Learning Paths**: If there are specific areas of C programming that interest you or if you want me to add more resources/examples in a particular area - feel free to suggest them. This repository is ever evolving and your input can help shape it into something even better for everyone's learning journey!
